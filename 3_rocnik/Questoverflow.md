# AppsLab Curriculum 2023-2024 ASP.NET Core with Angular

## Project Name: QuestOverflow

QuestOverflow is an engaging and interactive web application that gamifies the learning process through quests and solutions. It is based on the model of popular Q&A platforms such as StackOverflow, but instead of traditional question and answer sessions, it introduces a unique, fun, and educational experience in the form of quests and solutions. This application is developed using the ASP.NET Core framework for backend development, EF Core for database management, and Angular for frontend development.

The primary features of QuestOverflow are:

1. **User Registration and Profile Management:**
New users can register to the application providing necessary information. Once registered, they can set up their profiles, showcasing their level, total reward points, the guild they belong to, and their accomplished quests.

2. **Quest Posting and Solving:**
Users can post "quests," or complex problems requiring creative solutions. Any user can attempt to solve these quests. When a quest is solved, the user who posted the quest can mark it as solved, and the solver is rewarded with points.

3. **Reward Points and Leveling:**
Users earn reward points when they solve quests. As users accumulate more points, they can level up. Each level up increases the complexity of quests they can solve or post, thus enriching their problem-solving skills and enhancing their learning experience.

4. **Guild Creation and Joining:**
Users have the ability to create and manage "guilds" - groups of users working together to tackle more challenging quests. Each guild generates a unique hash code, and users can join a guild using this code. However, a user can be a part of only one guild at any given time.

5. **Dashboard:**
Every user has a personal dashboard where they can track their progress, view their solved and posted quests, monitor their guild activities, and check their reward points and level status.

6. **Guild Boards:**
Each guild has a board where members can communicate, collaborate on quests, and share solutions. It encourages teamwork and helps guild members to learn from each other.

7. **Quest Search and Filter:**
A powerful search functionality enables users to find quests based on keywords, difficulty levels, or within their guilds. Users can also filter quests based on their status - open or solved.

8. **Data Security and Integrity:**
The use of ASP.NET Core and EF Core ensures high data security and integrity. User data is securely stored and managed, ensuring user privacy and data protection.

QuestOverflow thus offers an engaging platform for learners to expand their knowledge while enjoying the process. It combines gamification with education, facilitating productive collaboration, and competitive learning.

## Features

As a Product Owner, the following features are key to our application, QuestOverflow:

0. **Development Environment Setup:** This is a prerequisite for all follow up features - preparing the development environment.

1. **Utilize Provided Registration and Login Capabilities:** This feature will use existing VS2022 template for creating ASP.NET Core with Angular web application including .NET 7 and Individual Account Authentication.

2. **Profile Management:** Users can manage their profiles, which include their personal information, (display picture), level, guild affiliation, and history of posted and solved quests.

3. **Quest Posting:** This feature allows users to post new quests. They can specify the quest details, complexity level, and the expected solution approach.

4. **Quest Solving:** Users can view and solve quests posted by other users. They can submit their solutions for the quest poster's review.

5. **Reward Points Allocation:** A system that automatically allocates reward points to users based on their quest-solving activity. The complexity of the solved quest would affect the amount of reward points earned.

6. **Leveling System:** A leveling system that promotes users to higher levels based on their accumulated reward points. Higher levels unlock more complex quests.

7. **Guild Creation and Member Limit:** Users can create new guilds, each generating a unique hash code which can be used by others to join. To maintain fair competition and encourage strategic collaboration, each guild is capped at a maximum of 7 members. Once this cap is reached, the guild will no longer accept new members until a spot becomes available.

8. **Guild Joining:** A feature that allows users to join an existing guild using its unique hash code. Note, users can only belong to one guild at a time.

9. **Dashboard:** A personalized user dashboard to display progress, active quests, completed quests, guild activities, reward points, and current level.

10. **Guild Leaderboard and Competition:** A dynamic leaderboard feature that ranks guilds based on their total accumulated reward points. This feature fosters a healthy competition among the guilds, motivating users to solve more quests and earn more points for their guild. The leaderboard will be updated in real-time, displaying the top performing guilds in the platform. It's important to note that the maximum member count for each guild is capped at 7 to ensure fair competition. This limitation also encourages more strategic quest selection and cooperative problem-solving within each guild.

11. **Quest Search and Filter:** A robust search and filter functionality to easily find quests based on various parameters such as keywords, complexity level, and guild.

12. **Mobile Responsiveness:** The application should be mobile responsive to ensure seamless user experience on all devices.
