# User Story: Navigate to Profile Page for Managing User Information

## Description

The aim of this user story is to allow registered users of the QuestOverflow application to easily navigate to their profile page. Once there, they should be able to view and edit their profile information such as personal details, level, guild affiliation, and history of quests posted and solved.

## Technical Perspective

The profile page will be implemented using Angular for the frontend, communicating with an ASP.NET Core backend using RESTful APIs. EF Core will be used for database management. Angular components for the profile page should be designed modularly, allowing for scalability and easy feature extensions in the future.

## User Perspective

From the end-user's standpoint, navigating to their profile should be a seamless and intuitive process. Once on the profile page, they should have a clear and easy-to-understand interface for viewing and editing their details.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Profile" link is available on the main navigation menu after successful login.
2. Clicking on the "Profile" link redirects the user to their profile page.
3. The profile page displays all necessary user information accurately.
4. There is an "Edit" button allowing users to update their information.
5. Any changes made should be instantly updated in the database and reflected in the user interface.
