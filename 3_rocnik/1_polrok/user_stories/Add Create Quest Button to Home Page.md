# User Story: Add "Create Quest" Button to Home Page

## Description

The objective of this user story is to integrate a "Create Quest" button on the home page of the QuestOverflow application. This button will serve as the entry point for users to initiate the quest creation process, making it easier for them to engage with the platform.

## Technical Perspective

From a technical standpoint, this requires adding a new UI element on the home page. The backend will remain largely unaffected. You'll be using Angular for frontend development, and the button will route the user to a new Quest creation form. The form itself will be the subject of another user story.

## User Perspective

From the user's viewpoint, the "Create Quest" button should be easily visible and accessible from the home page. Upon clicking, it should lead them to a form where they can specify the details of their quest. This improves user engagement and reduces friction in quest creation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. The "Create Quest" button must be visible on the home page.
2. The button should be appropriately styled to match the existing UI.
3. Clicking the button should route the user to a quest creation form.
4. The button should be accessible to users who are logged in.
