# User Story: Quest Creation Form Implementation

## Description

The purpose of this user story is to create a user-friendly quest creation form that appears when the "Create Quest" button is clicked. The form should allow users to input all necessary details related to the quest they are posting, thus serving as a cornerstone for the Quest Posting feature of the QuestOverflow application.

## Technical Perspective

From a technical standpoint, the front-end will utilize Angular to create the form, and it will include various input fields, dropdown menus, and possibly a rich text editor for describing the quest. On the back-end, ASP.NET Core will handle the form submission, and EF Core will manage the storage of the quest data into the database.

## User Perspective

From a userâ€™s viewpoint, clicking on the "Create Quest" button should smoothly transition them to a form where they can input quest details. The form should be intuitive and should include validation to ensure data integrity. The user should expect an immediate response upon form submission, such as a confirmation message.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. A "Create Quest" button should be prominently displayed and easily accessible.
2. Upon clicking the button, a form should appear with all necessary input fields for quest details.
3. The form should include client-side validation.
4. The form should successfully post the data to the back-end, resulting in the quest being added to the database.
5. A confirmation message should display to the user upon successful form submission.
