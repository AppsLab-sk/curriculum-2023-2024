# User Story: Implementing Built-in Email Signup

## Description

As a developer, the purpose of this user story is to leverage the built-in feature that allows users to sign up using their email address. This allows users to set up a new account with their personal email, thus saving time by avoiding manual implementation.

## Technical Perspective

The implementation requires integrating the existing email sign-up feature within ASP.NET Core, using Identity for authentication. Specific configurations must be made to enable this feature and ensure secure email verification.

## User Perspective

From the end-user's standpoint, this feature provides a convenient and familiar way to sign up. Users will expect a seamless registration process where they enter their email address, receive a verification email, and set up their account.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Email sign-up option is prominently displayed on the registration page
2. Verification email is sent to the user's provided email address
3. User can successfully register and log in using their verified email address
4. The feature complies with security and privacy standards
